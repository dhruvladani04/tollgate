# Tollgate

An MCP proxy that checks every tool call, and every tool result, with TypeSafe's Jev model
before letting it through. Each call ends one of three ways: allow, ask a human, or block.

The full spec is `docs/spec.md`. Read it completely before changing the design.

## How to work

- Build one milestone per session (M0 to M6 in the spec). At the end of a milestone, stop,
  show how to verify its "Done when" condition, and wait for go-ahead.
- Use the TypeSafe skill and the live docs (index: https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt) for
  anything about the Jev API. Do not guess request shapes. The installed SDK under
  `.venv/Lib/site-packages/typesafe_sdk` settles any disagreement.
- Python 3.12 with uv. Ask before adding a dependency the spec does not list.
- Write tests first for the policy engine and the pre-filter; they are pure functions.

## Rules from the spec

- **Pinned model.** Jev is pinned to version 1.13.0. Never use `jev-latest` or `jev-preview`
  in code or tests; `tests/test_jev_config.py` fails if either appears. The pinned ID for
  each route lives only in `src/tollgate/decide/jev.py`.
- **Code decides what code can decide.** Allowlists, path checks, secret regexes, size
  limits, arithmetic and date comparison never go to the model.
- **One judgment per Jev question.** Combine answers in the policy engine, not in prompts.
- **Small state.** Send Jev only `user_request`, `proposed_call` and trimmed `recent_context`.
- **Fail closed.** A Jev timeout, or a 429 after retries, means Ask, never Allow.
- **No magic numbers.** Every threshold lives in the policy YAML.
- **Keys stay out of the repo.** Code reads keys from the environment only. Local keys
  live in the gitignored `.env`, loaded with `uv run --env-file .env`. Do not read that
  file, and never put a key in a tracked file or a log.
- **Cache by exact request** so tests and evals do not re-spend.

## Jev access

`TOLLGATE_JEV_ROUTE` selects the route; the default is `typesafe`.

| Route | Key variable | Pinned model ID | Base URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `typesafe` | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | `jev-1.13.0` | `https://api.typesafe.ai` |
| `openrouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `typesafe/jev-1.13` | `https://openrouter.ai/api` |

Both routes speak the same System One API through `typesafe-sdk`. TypeSafe's own console
is early access; OpenRouter needs only an OpenRouter key.

## Commands

```text
uv sync                               install dependencies
uv run pytest                         run the tests (no network, no key needed)
uv run ruff check .                   lint
uv run ruff format .                  format
uv run --env-file .env python scripts/smoke_jev.py    one live Jev call
```

`.env` sets `TOLLGATE_JEV_ROUTE` and the key for that route.

## Milestone status

- **M0 Scaffold:** done. The live smoke call was answered by `jev-1.13.0` on the
  `typesafe` route on 8 Oct 2026.
- M1 to M6: not started.
